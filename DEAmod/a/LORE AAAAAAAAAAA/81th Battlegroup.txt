81th Battlegroup

81 stands as a oddball amongst many yet she isn't the only one. 81th Battlegroup mainly focuses on hit and run tactics while also supporting extraordinary complex technologies gained by 77th battlegroup. Their doctorine is mostly in line with other non-specalised battlegroups where they truly shine is their origin and motives. Led by Field Marshall Osman Pamukoglu 81th fleet was mainly consistent of ethnically Anatolian crews and generals thus naming the Battlefleet Anatolia's Spear. Their doctorine does not get in like with others regardless and mainy follow a heavy emphasis on Fighter Assaults and Boarding Parties. There are even rumours about them engaging a lesser human civilization and killing their emperor with boarding tactics while using horses to skit around in the enemy vessels. 81 really shines the best in their boardings. One veteran even remarked strongly as the battles as fun and organized yet any witnesses of these boardings mainly 14th and 24th describe them as chaotic and absolutely brutal.
