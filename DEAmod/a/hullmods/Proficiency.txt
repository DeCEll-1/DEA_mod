Proficiency

81th as remarked specialises on Fighter combat and Boardings. Yet due to advanced shield and PD technologies this is almost made impossible. Thus leaving the 81th with only one other option. Going into the orbit. 

%10 faster fighter replacement
%15 more damage against ships larger than cruisers
%30 less pilot loss on fighter destructions
And a basically ground support package but two times better


All of these upgrades cost the vessel to have virtually no skeleton crew possiblity. Ä°ncreasing the crew needed by a absurd %75
